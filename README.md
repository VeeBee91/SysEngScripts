# SysEngScripts
Collection of System Engineering scripts

These scripts are not meant to be run automatically. 
They are not parameterized. 
The scripts are meant to be copy pasted, replace the parameters/variables where necessary and then manually run.
Since there is no error checking/reporting this is important.
